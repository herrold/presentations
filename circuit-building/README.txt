This directory contains various "handout sheets" for a circuit building
activity. The emphasis here is on building simple electronics circuits rather
than theory or presentation.

The circuits are mostly cribbed from other presentations within this repo,
although the steps have been customized to optimize ease of construction of
each circuit standalone. In other presentations, the steps are optimized as
part of a series of circuits including component removal relative to
previously built circuits.
